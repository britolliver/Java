                                                    Lesson 1: programs and algorithms
A computer is a machine capable of processing data.It can only understand machine language.

A program/software is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task. Initially written in zeros and ones; created more human friendly languages
to write in like Java. These languages are translated behind the scenes into computer language and then interpreted by
the computer's hardware.

algorithm- a high level step by step guide to complete a task; helps you solve programs; can implement it using a programming language
Ex: Calculate an employee's gross pay
1.Get numbers of hours worked
2.GEt hourly pay rate
3. Multiply hours and pay rate
4.Display results


Purpose of programs is to provide instructions to a computer to enable it to perform tasks. Programs are implementations of algorithms.

                                                   Lesson 2: Java Fundamentals

Code is another word for programs.

Source code is another word used for programs.

A package in java is a folder or container that holds java files. Packages should be all lowercase.

Packages contain Java files, also known as classes.

Java classes, by convention start with an uppercase letter for each word.

If your java file is within a package, then the first line must declare the package.

The words in orange are reserved words in java. Can't be used to name things.

Everything between the two braces will belong to that particular java class.

In order to run code from within a class, it must be inside a Method. The default method in java is the" main" one.
 When you execute the class, it will first look for the main method within the class. It is the starting point and it must be
 defined as "public static void main(String arg[]){}"

Keep in mind who you are programming for.

you can add numbers and special characters except hyphens and alike at the end of variable names not the front
